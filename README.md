# Challenge10-SVG-Logo-Maker

## Description

In this weeks chalenge we created a line application that creates SVG logos. The application uses inquirer to ask the user questions on how they would like to design the logo. Shape, Letters and colors for each. After the user answers the prompts the app will generate a logo with the inputs it recieved.

## Installation 

The app is powered by Node.js, inquirer v8.2.4, and a file system module (node package manager). It also uses jest v29.7.0 (node package manager) for the unit testing in this application.
